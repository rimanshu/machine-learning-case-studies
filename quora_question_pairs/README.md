## Real World / Business Objectives and Constraints


1. The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.
2. You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can choose any threshold of choice.
3. No strict latency requirement.
4. Interpretability is partially important.


_P.S:I couldn't able to upload the pickle files, as the overall pickle files size was more than 2GB. After zipping it, it was around 1.3GB. But maximum file size allowed in GitHub is 100MB. So create a folder called `pickle` before executing the Ipython notebook. Any comments/suggestions/inputs are most welcome_
